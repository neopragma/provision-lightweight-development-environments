# Argent Linux: FAIL

The [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Distributions_based_on_Gentoo) lists several distros they don't support, but that they know to be based on Gentoo. One of them is [Argent](https://github.com/Rogentos). Based on its description, it sounds like a good candidate for building out a lightweight development environment.

The Rogentos Github account has quite a few projects that appear to be related to Argent and other Linux work, but there is no documentation at all. Therefore, it was impossible to guess where to begin or which projects might be necessary to build a working system. 

Useless.
