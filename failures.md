# Failure stories

I tried quite a few distros to find some that would satisfy the use case of a developer who wants to spin up a lightweight development environment quickly. Most of the ones I tried did not satisfy that need for one reason or another. 

In some cases, the failure was doubtless caused by my own ignorance, or my impatience after spending several days trying to build the thing (Arch, Gentoo). Several days just to set up one environment isn't the goal of the exercise, anyway. That is the reason to avoid types [1] and [2] for this purpose (see "Choosing a distro" above). 

In other cases, the system simply would not function the way its promoters claimed it would. This was often the case for distros in the type [5] category, in which we start with an out-of-the-box desktop system and remove packages not needed in the lightweight environment. 

Experiences like these squeezed the spectrum of available installation options into the [3] to [4] range, where we find the successful attempts such as CentOS, Debian, and Ubuntu Server.
